#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast S4E34 - A Conversation so Intense it Might as Well Be Psychedelic | John Vervaeke
`[1:11:05]` Peterson: I think the atheist critique of religion is a critique at a propositional
level. 

Vervaeke: I've made a similar point Jordan, I've made the point that they're not paying attention 
to—I mean when Nietzsche runs into the marketplace, he is talking to the _atheists_ when he says
"you don't know what you've done when you've killed God." Right? And so to think that religion is
primarily about asserting propositions for which there is no evidence is to miss all of the 
non-propositional—so I make a distinction, and it lines up with this, I think that religion is not
primarily about _knowledge_, I think it's primarily about _wisdom_. Because wisdom is about that 
fundamental transformation—

Peterson: It's about embodying it. It's about establishing a relationship with it.

Vervaeke: Yes!

Peterson: It's about worshipping it. 

Vervaeke: ...about taking it into your identity, that's what I meant. 

`[1:14:00]` Peterson: We've killed our religion by presuming it was a set of axiomatic 
presuppositions and listening to the 19th century rationalist atheists.

Vervaeke: Well what we've done is we have confused modernity's understanding of religion with the
phenomena, which is I think a fundamental mistake. 

Peterson: No... with our blind critique of the phenomenon.

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast S4E31 - Intimations of Creativity | Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman
`[26:00]` Kaufman: It's like we don't even _want_ to know the truth [of the role that genes play], 
in certain circumstances. 

Peterson: Y'know I've thought about that too, it's not surprising that people don't want to know
the truth about IQ, because it's quite nasty. I mean, there are _huge_ differences between people
in their intrinsic ability to learn. And that has walloping economic and social consequences. And
so there's a bitterness in that, that's... 

I mean I still think we have to address it and take it seriously, so for me it's like: IQ does the 
liberal and the conservative political perspectives incredible damage, because the conservative are 
likely to say "well there's a job for everyone if they just get up and y'know, get at it." And the 
liberals like to say "well, everybody can be trained to do everything" and BOTH of those are wrong.
Because there's a large number of people who are not, who have enough trouble with abstraction that
finding a productive job in a complex society has become extraordinary difficult. And that's a 
_huge_ problem. And we have no idea what to do with it, we won't even look at it!

#### The Psychology Podcast with Scott Barry Kaufman - Sam Harris || Free Will (Part 2)
`[43:10]` Kaufman: I love this transcendent view. And also the idea that you—the point that you 
make about hate. Y'know, hate doesn't really have a place to program in the robot here once we
understand that there's no ultimate free will...

...But what I don't understand is in applying that in your own life, you don't apply that when you 
talk about Trump, I mean you get really angry about...you don't say things like 'we should have 
sympathy for Trump'—

Harris: —but that's a misunderstanding. So there're certainly moments where I'm captured by 
something I find so despicable that I'm blind to my own philosophy here. Like, I'm lost in thought;
I'm identified with a moment of finding Trump despicable, say, and... yeah, so I'm just in the 
dream, I'm asleep and dreaming and unaware of

Kaufman: You're human. You're human. 

Harris: Yeah. I'm not a Buddha. But much of the time a different thing is happening. And it's not 
_personal_, it's not that I hate Trump _personally_. It's that I hate—and again this is all 
slightly anachronistic because he's no longer President, so I'm basically never thinking about him 
now which is wonderful—but it's not that I hated him personally, it's that I hated _the fact of 
him_. Right? The fact that we made this sort of man President was so terrible...

...He's so bad, as a reliably malfunctioning robot. It's a little bit analogous to if we elected
a rhinoceros to be President, I'd be fucking tearing my hair out over how awful that is. At no
point am I imagining that the rhinoceros can be anything other than a rhinoceros, and at no point
am I wishing suffering upon the rhinoceros. I don't _hate_ the rhinoceros. The rhinoceros just 
shouldn't be President of the United States...

...And in some sense we elected a rhinoceros President. And so I spent a long time complaining 
about that, because of all the things to which that was connected in our society and in our 
possible future that were worth worrying about.

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast S4E41 - The Four Dos and Don'ts of Divorce | Warren Farrell
`[1:25:40]` Peterson: You cite an interesting stat here, too, which I thought was worth talking 
about. Um...  on who should pay the bill on the first date. Um...seventy-two percent of women 
think that a man should pay the full bill on the first date. Now remember: they've already 
selected this man and what that means is that he's likely to be at or above them in the 
socioeconomic hierarchy. And perhaps slightly older, so y'know, in some sense they can afford—he 
can afford—to pay better than she can.  

But, in any case, eighty-two percent of _men_ think the same. And so men are playing the hypergamy
game even more intensely than women are, at least with regards to that particular statistic. So...

Farrell: And this gets into the psychology of the pay gap because many women feel okay about that 
because they feel like 'okay, men earn more than I do for the same work.' And in fact that is not
really accurate. Here is what _is_ accurate: **fathers earn more than moms do. The pay gap is not
men—women. The pay gap is dads versus moms.** And when dads become dads, they're far more likely to
give up the things that they love to do that pay less, and do the things that they like to do a lot
less; quit that musician gig that paid much less, and do something responsible, quote unquote, like
selling product Y.

`[1:47:33]` Peterson: I've made light of \[rejection\], by teasing my class, my students. I say... 
well, what's the joke... "you're perfectly suitable as a companion, but in no way should your 
genetic material be allowed to propogate itself into the next generation." Right, that's the core
of rejection, and it _cuts to the bone_. And it isn't obvious that that's sufficiently understood,
how terrified men are of female rejection. 

...And that's the advantage of dating sites like Tinder, because the rejection is taken out of the
game, essentially, or it's hidden—masked. Tinder is a revolutionary technology because it alters
the reward structure, reward and punishment structure of dating. I mean, it's incendiary. And 
named properly.

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast S4E20 - You're Next | Dr. Rima Azar
`[1:00:50]` I could see a power play. I could also see a corruption of the idea of identity.
Identity isn't merely what you feel you are, at any given point. Identity is something you
negotiate with others, you _have_ to negotiate with others, because they have to know what the
rules are! And if you can change the rules and make them arbitrary at any point then how can
anyone play with you? And maybe if you're setting up a game that no one can play you're doing that
because _you're_ the one that has a problem with power. Just maybe.

#### Identity politics and the Marxist lie of white privilege
[Vancouver, 3 Nov 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfH8IG7Awk0)

`[37:00]` The work [i.e. the curse upon Adam and Eve in the garden] is the sacrifice of the present 
for the future... So that's it, that's the curse, in some sense. The thing is there's a _theory_ in
there, there's an interesting theory of _suffering_ implicit in that story. The theory of suffering 
is that suffering is built into the structure of self-conscious being—it's built right into 
the structure. So if you're a self-conscious being, that's your lot.

It isn't someone else's fault.

It isn't a consequence of sociological oppression.

It isn't a consequence of the fact that our society isn't organized properly.

**It's just part of _being_.**

`[2:20:23]` audience question (paraphrased): Would you agree with the sentiment that the left pushes 
so hard and keeps doubling down, and they just want to "win"? 

`[2:21:59]` Well first of all...[t]hings can go out of hand very rapidly. And the reason they do
that is because of positive feedback loops...and that's what polarization is. It's like: I tap you,
you tap me. I slap you, you punch me. Well, up it goes. 

Well I think that's partly why, in the New Testament for example, there's an injunction that says,
uh, [turn the other cheek; resist not evil.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A39)
_WHY?_

[pause] Because otherwise you get into a positive feedback loop and you'd better look the hell out.
And things can tilt very, very rapidly.

So I would say: _maintain self control. And don't aim to "win"._ Aim at peace. Because winning...
that's not peace. It's better to aim for peace. 

...
So it really is important not to "win". It's like fighting with your wife: you don't "win". You 
can't, cuz you have to live with her. You can't win! But maybe you can solve the problem and bring
about peace. And so you gotta practice doing that, practice restraint. 

And remember, too, that these people you're talking about who are radical leftists is that most of
the time they're not. Like they're ninety-five percent like you. And if you pull them out of the 
mob they're just like your neighbor's nineteen-year-old kid who's kinda clueless, and rebellious.
And who you might even _like_. 

...
You don't wanna make a low-resolution, homogeneous representation of them. And so that's why, again,
I think **instead of "winning" you turn to your own development. You turn to your own development. 
You do what you can to stop doing the things you're doing that aren't good.** Cuz you're not gonna 
hurt anybody if you do that. All you're gonna do is help. Otherwise you'll participate in this 
polarization. 

...
We have to be careful... I really do believe it, I truly believe this—this is something I learned
in part from Solzhenitsyn and in part from Jung—is that **the way that you set the world straight 
is by constraining the malevolence in your own heart.**

And that's no joke, man. That's no easy thing. And that's a good voyage for people to go on if they
want something difficult and worthwhile to do.

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 58 - October 2018 Q & A
`[35:57]` *If* Kavanaugh withdrew after being nominated, here's what might happen:
* It would be read as an admission of guilt on his part.
* It would embolden those who would use reputation destruction as a political maneuver.
* It would weaken the generally and vitally important idea of the presumption of innocence.
* It would indicate weakness on the part of the Republicans at a key moment prior to the November 
elections.
* It would mean that an innocent man has been successfully pilloried by a mob.
* It would validate the use of allegations of past behavior, well past any reasonable expiry date, 
as a weapon.
* It would destroy the Republican opportunity to choose a Supreme Court justice, hand the 
Democrats an unearned victory, embitter a large percentage of the conservative base who would 
regard the withdrawal as a betrayal, and last and perhaps least,
* Violate my own personal adage (for what that's worth) of 'don't apologize if you haven't done 
anything wrong.'

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 57 - Dr. Oz - Jordan Peterson's Rules to Live By
`[1:01:03]` Oz: "If zero is ultra-liberal and hundred is the ultra-conservative, alt-right, where 
are you on that spectrum? Do you think of yourself as more conservative, more liberal, I know over 
your life you've changed..."

Peterson: "Well I'm a traditionalist in many senses, y'know, but I'm a very creative person, so 
it's very difficult, temperamentally, for me to place myself on the political spectrum. It's not 
like I don't think the dispossessed deserve a political voice. That's why I was interested in 
socialist politics as a kid. And I understand perfectly well that hierarchies dispossess, and that 
something has to be done about that.

But I also think that we mess with fundamental social structures at our great peril. I think we've 
destabilized marriage very badly and that's not been good for people, especially not good for 
children. But I don't think it's been good for adult men and women, either.

And I *certainly*, as a social scientist...one of the things you learn if you're a social 
scientist, and you're well-educated and informed, is that if you take a complex system—let's 
imagine you have a complex system—and you have a hypothesis about how to intervene so it will 
improve. OK, so what will you learn? You'll learn, once you implement the intervention, that you 
didn't understand the system, and that your stupid intervention did a bunch of things you didn't 
expect it to do, many of which ran counter to your original intent. And you *inevitably* learn 
that.

So...I learned that...I had a whole series of very wise mentors who *insisted* to everyone they 
talked to who was interested in public policy, for example, that when they put in place a 
well-meaning public policy initiative that they put aside a substantial portion of the budget to 
evaluate the outcome of the initiative. Because the probability that the initiative would produce 
the results desired was virtually zero. And I believe that that's technically true.

And so that tilts me in the conservative direction because I think 'well, that's sort of working, 
that system!' And I'm also not a utopian, so I don't expect systems to work perfectly. If they're 
not *degenerating into absolute tyranny*, I tend to think they're doing quite well. Because if you 
look worldwide and you look at the entire course of human history, degeneration into abject 
tyranny is the *norm*.

And so if you see systems like our system, say in the democratic Western world, that are 
struggling by not too badly, it's like you should be in AWE of those structures, because they're 
so difficult to produce and so unlikely.

And then I think well you take a system that's working not too badly and think 'well, I'm going to 
radically improve it.' It's like, no...you're not. You're not gonna radically improve it. You 
*might* be able to improve it incrementally, if you devoted a large part of your entire life to 
it, and you were very humble about your methods and your ambition. But if you think that some 
careless tweak of this complex system, as a consequence of the ideological presuppositions you 
learned in three weeks in your social justice class at university and that's gonna produce a 
radical improvement? It's like, you can't even begin to fathom the depths of your ignorance."

`[1:51:06]` "Why does reality have an adversarial nature? Why would God set something on you... 
say, an enemy?

**An adversary makes you stronger.**

'Well isn't that cruel?' It's like, not if the person who sets the adversary on you believes that 
you could *win.*"

`[2:13:43]` "The way I look at this is: let's say that you're blessed with success, so you have a 
lot of resources at your disposal, ok. Now you can feel guilty about that, and perhaps, to some 
degree, you should. That's between you and your conscience.

But let's say that you've generated your resources in a fair game. And that a lot of people have 
benefitted along with you, so you've played a straight game. Now you have all these resources. OK, 
so what should you do with the resources? Well, *impulsive pleasure.* It's like well, a little of 
that goes a long ways, and it's liable to take you down in a very short period of time.

So how about not that, OK, it's not a good medium- to long-term solution. OK how about: *your 
ethical responsibility grows in proportion to the resources that you have at your control.* And 
the right thing to do is that as you become more competent, authoritative, and able, is to expand 
the range in which you're operating. To do more good."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 55 - August 2018 Q & A
`[1:10:07]` "Now, I've put forward the proposition that the winner of the meta-game is also the 
person who goes out to conquer the unknown. Now, let's see if we can take that apart a bit.

Well, one of the attributes of being a good sport, let's say, is that you're trying to extend your 
skill during the game. And so you *are* confronting the unknown in the game because you're trying 
to get better at the game. And then you're also doing that in a way that's of benefit to the team. 
And so then you can imagine that **being a team leader, in the meta-game**—which is the game of 
extending your skill across the broadest possible set of games—**is analogous to leading a team 
into the unknown.**

So if you're gonna go confront the unknown, you're probably not gonna do it alone, although you 
could. And to some degree you have to be alone, but you're generally going to do it in a 
cooperatively and competitive way. I mean that's why in stories like *The Lord of the Rings* and 
*The Hobbit*, for example, and even *Harry Potter* for that matter: none of those people are 
alone. They *lead* or are part of a broader social group. And they're important, and they're team 
players in that group.

So the team player element seems to be something that's common to conquering the unknown and to 
reciprocal altruism and to being invited to play the largest number of games. And the question 
then is what makes an effective leader? And **an effective leader is someone who's able to 
*synthesize* the group and to lead it forward towards the goal."**

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 51 - Russell Brand
`[34:20]` Peterson: "[the Self] is often composed of things you refuse or weren't willing to 
develop. And so when Jung talks about, for example, the incorporation of the Shadow is that you've 
constructed an ego and there's things it can do and can't do that it's allowed to do and isn't 
allowed to do, and then there's a shadow domain that would consist of those things you could do 
but haven't. And some of that's terrible, but some it's what you need to break free."

Brand: "Is there an infinite variety in the Shadow? Or are there sort of templates there, would 
you say, that are a common component of the shadow—"

Peterson: "—aggression. Aggression and lust. Because they're the most difficult to integrate into 
the ego. Because aggression destroys and, of course, lust subsumes the individual to, well, to 
sexual desire."

---
#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 47 - Warren Farrell - The Absolute Necessity of Fathers
`[51:33]` "Well the thing about the games that's different—like the video games—what's different 
is... so, a game for a little kid has to be immediately rewarding. That's why rough-and-tumble 
play works, for example, it has to be immediately rewarding. And then the game shades into real 
life. But as the game shades into real life, what happens is the rewards are deferred. And you get 
more and more disciplined at not being immediately rewarded, like when you're learning to read or 
play the piano, for the long-term goal.

The thing about video games is that they DO require the development of skill; but the immediate 
reward is built-in *along with* the delayed reward. Because otherwise the game wouldn't be fun for 
someone who's learning. So the problem is that a lot of real-life games aren't necessarily fun 
*while you're learning them*. 'Cuz you have to attain a certain level of mastery and that requires 
discipline.

That's also what's wrong with the idea that children can just learn in keeping with what they're 
spontaneously interested in. It's like there's some truth in that, because why not follow a 
child's interests, but the problem is that many highly skilled endeavors—virtually any endeavor 
that's going to be of economic or productive utility—requires [an] apprenticeship where there's a 
lot of grinding. There's a lot of just disciplined repetition."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 43 - Jordan Peterson's Rules for Life with Richard Fidler
`[38:49]` Fidler: "You wrote a book early on in your academic career called _Maps of Meaning_, and 
what were you looking for when you were writing that book?"

Peterson: "I was doing two things: I was trying to understand what the fundamental issue was at 
the heart of the Cold War; and then I was trying to determine whether what the Cold War was was 
merely an argument between two hypothetically equally valid narratives...which would be kind of a 
postmodern view of it, right. 'Well, there's a radical left-wing narrative and it's arbitrary, but 
perhaps we can organize society along its guidelines. And there's a free market capitalist, 
democratic narrative, and it's just as arbitrary, and perhaps we can organize society along 
_those_ lines, but one's arbitrary and so is the other. And so is any other narrative you might 
impose.'

And so I was curious about that because I thought, 'well, it looks like there's something really 
at stake here. We've generated tens of thousands of unbelievably powerful weapons, we've aimed 
them at each other, we're willing to _put the world to the torch_ because of this argument. Maybe 
there's something to it.'

So I went into it with what I would say is an open mind, trying to understand if it was merely an 
argument between two arbitrary systems of moral relativism, or if there was something else at 
stake. And what I discovered, I would say—partly by reading the works of other people who had 
discovered this before me, let's say—is that no, they weren't equivalent systems in any way at all.

The West is founded on something that's far deeper than mere arbitrary narrative. Part of that is 
**the idea of the sovereignty and divinity of the individual, which is the most powerful idea 
there is—the most powerful human idea there is.**

And it's also the idea that, without which...in the absence of that idea you cannot produce a 
functioning society, at any level of analysis. You can't function in relationship to yourself, 
because you won't take yourself with any degree of seriousness. You won't function well within 
your family because you won't treat your family members like they matter. And you won't function 
well as a citizen because you'll be nihilistic and cynical."

---
#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 42 - March 2018 Q & A
`[28:40]` "I think that the failure to separate church and state...or, even if we don't call it a 
failure, the fact that church and state hasn't technically been separated in Islam, makes it 
difficult to understand how it's possible for Islam and modern Western democratic traditions to 
coexist. *I* don't know how that gap can be bridged.

You could say 'well, with good will' and let's hope that's the case. That doesn't mean I don't 
think that Muslims can live in a modern Western democracy, I mean there are many many kinds of 
Muslims just like there are many kinds of Jews and Christians. And then there's the problem of the 
current proclivity of the extreme end of the Muslim fundamentalist world to be very violent in 
very many ways.

`[1:31:53]` "'Do I believe in the crucifixion?'

Well, certainly, I mean people...the crucifixion, how can you not believe in it if you think 
symbolically...it's like, human beings are—we're eternally crucified, right? Our lives are tragic 
and they end in death and we're all betrayed. We're _all_ betrayed. We all experience betrayal. So 
you can't _not_ believe in the crucifixion.

'Do you believe in the resurrection?'

Well, people die and are reborn all the time. This is what [the asker] is after here, 'I'm a sober 
alcohol and drug addict.' Well y'know you had to let a lot of you die when you stopped being an 
addict and something new be reborn. It's like what's the ultimate significance of that? And how's 
it tied to the notion of bodily resurrection? Well, I don't know what the ultimate significance 
is, but it does seem to be the pathway through life."

`[1:32:35]` "To believe. **I would say you start believing not by attempting to convince yourself 
that the statement 'there is a God' is true like a fact is true, but to act out the proposition 
that you should shoulder your cross and stumble uphill towards the City of God;** _that's_ belief, 
man. And you can do that, right away.

Now, you might ask: 'well do I have any guarantee that that has transcendent and universal 
significance?' It's like well, it's not a bad model for emulation, so it has universal 
significance in that regard. We each have to shoulder the tragedy of our existence and stumble 
upwards despite that; that has universal significance.

'Does it have universal significance outside of life? Like in the eternal realm?' [pause]

It wouldn't surprise me if it did. I suppose it would depend on what you mean by the eternal 
realm. It seems to have significance in the eternal realm of consciousness. It seems to have 
significance in the eternal realm of conscious fantasy—implicit fantasy, and mythology.

'How is it connected with the factual world?' [pause] 

That's a hard question because the factual world in some sense divorced itself from that 
transcendental world during the development of the scientific methodology. So, 'never the twain 
shall meet'. It's a methodological issue in part."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 41 - Quillette - Discussion with Editor Claire Lehmann
`[04:43]` "So the stereotype literature is interesting, because one of the things so-called 
stereotype researchers have failed to do is to distinguish stereotype from heuristics. People use 
low-resolution representations of the world all the time, to simplify it. And it's absolutely 
vital that we do that—we cannot function without categorization.

And I know this was a problem with [[Mahzarin] 
Banaji's](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/mahzarin-r-banaji) work—she did some of the 
early work on stereotyping—and I remember she did a talk at Harvard when I was teaching in Boston, 
and she was taken to task by the audience, who weren't all social psychologists, for failing to 
distinguish between categorization and stereotyping. And like that's actually a really big 
problem—it's not a trivial issue with regards to that research."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 28 - Abraham: Father of Nations
`[1:20:12]` “It’s pretty obvious that if you treat people well, if you really think about it and 
you’re not being naïvely optimistic, and like y’know a ‘nice, good person’, with all the weakness 
that _that_ intimates. If you’re being hard-nosed and sensible you understand that if you treat 
people—if you trust people—that’s an act of courage. If you’re not naïve, right; if 
you’re naïve it’s an act of stupidity. Because you might get bit, and you probably will. And if 
you’re naïve and you get bit, you will suffer for it, it’ll traumatize you.

But if you’re _not_ naïve, and you _know_ you can get bit, then you might ask, well, **what should 
you do with people? And the answer is you should trust them.** Not because you’re naïve and not 
because they couldn’t betray you and not because you don’t know that they could betray you, but 
because if you hold out your hand in trust then you’re inviting the best part of that person to 
step forward and that won’t happen unless you take that initial step and that’s courage, not 
naïvety.

And so to trust someone once your eyes are open, that’s an act of courage. And that opens up the 
world."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 28 - Abraham: Father of Nations
`[38:47]` "Here's something I learned about true art—this is something I learned from Jung, 
it's so smart—so you imagine that you inhabit the land that you know, conceptually and 
practically, and imagine outside of that there's that massive space of things you don't know, and 
even outside of that there's this space of things that NO ONE knows, right, so it's the known 
territory surrounded by the unknown—that's the canonical archetypal landscape. And the 
unknown manifests itself to you and that's where new knowledge comes from.

But the question is: how is that knowledge generated? It doesn't just leap from completely unknown 
to completely articulated in one move, that isn't how it happens. It has to pass through stages of 
analysis before it becomes articulable. And the first stage of analysis as far as I can tell is 
that you act it out; so if something _really_ surprises you, the first way that you react to it, 
your category's actually embodied like this, `[pantomimes a frightened cat]` that's your first 
category. It's not conceptual at all, it's _embodied_.

And then maybe you start to...you're at home at night and y'know something startles you and you 
freeze, and then it's dark and your imagination populates the darkness with whatever might be 
making the noise. And that's the sequence, it's like: embodied response, imaginative 
representation, exploration, articulation. That's how information moves from the unknown to the 
known.

And artists are the people who stand on that imagistic frontier, and they put themselves out into 
the unknown and they take a piece of it and they transform it into some mythological image. And 
they don't know what they're doing exactly, because they're guided by their intuition if they're 
real artists, otherwise they're just propagandists. They have to be _contending_ with something 
they don't understand. And what they do is they make it more understandable."

`[43:55]` "You have to admit, even if you think about it as a modern person, that the act of 
sacrificing something [like a baby goat] might have some dramatic compulsion to it. Y'know, to go 
out into a flock and to take something that's newborn and to cut its throat and to bleed it and to 
burn it...might be a way of indicating to yourself that you're actually _serious_ about something. 
And it isn't so obvious that we have rituals of seriousness like that now.

And so it's not so obvious that we're actually serious about anything. And so maybe that's not 
such a good thing. And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that these people were so archaic and 
primitive and superstitious. It's possible that they knew something that we don't. And certainly 
in the Abrahamic stories one of the things that maintains Abraham's covenant with God is his 
continual willingness to sacrifice, and so that sacrificial issue is _so_ important because **you 
are not committed to something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it. Commitment and sacrifice 
are the _same thing_.**

And I think it borders on miraculous that those concepts are embedded into this narrative at the 
level of dramatic action, y'know, instead of abstract explanation—people are acting this out. And 
the fundamental conception is so profound that it's really quite...awe-inspiring, it's 
breathtaking, really, when you understand what message is trying to be conveyed. You have to make 
sacrifices and what do you have to sacrifice? **You have to sacrifice that which is most valuable 
to you currently that's stopping you.** And God only knows what that is; it's certainly the _worst 
of you_, it's certainly that. And God only knows to what degree you're in love with the worst of 
you."

`[1:51:18]` "Y'know when Christ comes back in the Book of Revelation to judge people—because he 
comes back as a judge—and virtually everyone gets cast out with the chaff and not saved with the 
wheat...he says something very interesting, he appears in the vision with a sword coming out of 
his mouth, it's a horrifying vision. And he divides humanity into the damned and the saved. He 
says something very interesting. He says: 'To those who are neither hot nor cold I will spew you 
out of my mouth.' And it's a disgust metaphor, right, and what it says is **the worst punishment 
isn't waiting for those who committed to something and did wrong. The worst punishment is reserved 
for those who committed to nothing and stayed on the fence.**

And that's really something, too. That's really something to think about. And it's also something 
I believe to be true because I see that stasis is utterly destructive. Because there's no 
progress, all there is is movement backwards. There's aging, and suffering, and no progress. And 
so to not commit to anything is the worst of all transgressions. To commit means to put your body 
and soul into something, to offer your life as a sacrifice means that you're willing to make a 
bargain with fate. And the bargain is: 'I'm going to act as if, if I give it my all, then the best 
possible thing will happen because of that.'

And to not see the analogy between that and the act of faith in God is to misunderstand the story 
completely."

`[11:23]` “Just because you _read_ something doesn’t mean you have a _right_ to it. You have to 
understand it, and understanding something that’s deep means a deep transformation, means you have 
to _live it._"

`[36:55]` Weiss: "Since we're on the subject of universities, you recently said that what 
universities have done is beyond forgiveness. I wonder if you can explain what you mean by that; a 
second connected question is...should we abolish universities, or—"

Peterson: "No, they'll do that themselves." [laughter]

Weiss: "...let's hear a little bit about what you think renders them beyond forgiveness."

Peterson: "Well...
* They're overwhelmingly administratively top-heavy. And they don't spend any more money on the 
faculty than they did 30 years ago. And the cost of that administrative top-heaviness, which is 
well-documented—not by me, by other people, and it's been that way, it's been accelerating over 
the last 20 years—has been a radical increase in tuition fees, especially compared to the radical 
decrease in price of most things over the last 20 years.
* Now, so they've become administratively top-heavy. The way—and this is especially true in the 
United States—the way that's been managed is that unsuspecting students are given free access to 
student loans that will cripple them through their 30s and their 40s, and the universities are 
enticing them to extend their care-free adolescence for a four-year period at the cost of 
mortgaging their future earnings in a deal that does not allow for escape through bankruptcy.

So it's essentially a form of indentured servitude; there's no excuse whatsoever for that. [It] 
means the administrators have learned to pick the future pockets of their students. And because 
they also view them in some sense as sacred cash cows and fragile, let's say, because you might 
wonder why the students are being treated like they're so fragile, it's like... 'well, we don't 
want them to drop out now, do we? If they drop out then we can't get our hands on their future 
earnings in a way that they can't escape from.'

And that cripples the economy, because the students come out overlaid with debt that they'll never 
pay off, right at the time that they should be at the peak of their ability to take entrepreneurial
risks. So they can't do that, because they're too crippled by debt. And so that's absolutely 
appalling.
* They're gerrymandering the accreditation processes so that the degree no longer has its credible 
value.
* They're enabling the activist disciplines which have zero academic credibility whatsoever in my 
estimation, and I'm perfectly willing to defend that claim.
* And by enabling the activist disciplines they're allowing for the distribution of this 
absolutely nonsensical view that western society is fundamentally a patriarchal tyranny, which is 
absurd on at least five dimensions of analysis but is becoming increasingly the thing you have to 
believe if you're allowed to speak in public

...
* They're not teaching students to read critically.
* They're not introducing them to great literature.
* They're not teaching them to write.

The list goes on and on."

`[52:02]` "Now you might ask 'well, why is that [differentiation of the right and left brain] 
conceptualized as masculine versus feminine—because it's not male versus female, by the way, those 
are not the same thing, because one's conceptual. That's extraordinarily complicated. I think the 
reason is that we're social-cognitive primates, and that our fundamental cognitive categories—a 
priori cognitive categories—*are* masculine, feminine, and child. It's something like that, that's 
the fundamental structure of reality. Because we're social creatures and we view reality as 
something that's essentially social in its nature.

And then when we started to conceptualize reality *outside* the social world—which wasn't very 
long ago by the way, and which is something that animals virtually don't do at all—we used those a 
priori social categories as filters through which we interpreted the external world. And we're 
sort of stuck with that, in some deep sense. And you might say 'well, why do we have to be stuck 
with that?' It's like, well because some things are very difficult to change.

Like if you go watch a story, and the characters in this story slot themselves into those 
archetypal categories, then you'll understand the story. And if they don't, you won't. Because 
your understanding is predicated on application of the archetypal a prioris to the story. You 
wouldn't *understand* it otherwise."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 44 - Lafayette College - The Mill Series
`[29:49]` “And the way that totalitarian states develop is that people give up their right to be, 
the right to exist with their own thoughts. They lie! That’s what happens, is that individuals 
sacrifice their own souls to the dictates of the state. And then everything goes badly sideways. 
And it’s like, you think how much evidence for that do we need? Y’know, you’re looking at a 
quarter of a billion deaths. It’s like, isn’t that enough?

Well the people that I read were profound—Victor Frankel is a good example for beginners if you 
wanna read about this sort of thing, wrote a book called _Man’s Search for Meaning_. And Frankel, 
and also Solzhenitsyn, and a variety of other commentators as well who _really_ looked into what 
happened both in Nazi Germany and the Communist states. **Their conclusion was universal: that the 
lies and tyranny of the state are aided and abetted by the moral sacrifice of the individual.** 
It’s not top-down, the Nazis telling you what to do and you’re all innocent and obey. THAT’S not 
how it works—is you falsify your being, bit by bit, and you end up where you don’t wanna be. And 
that’s a _bad_ idea.

And if you’re interested in that there’s a great book called _Ordinary Men_…you read that and you 
won’t be the same person afterwards, so I would beware of reading it. But it’s a story about these 
policemen in Germany. So they were middle-aged guys, y’know, and they grew up and were socialized 
before the Nazis came to power, so they were just your typical middle class policemen. And they 
were brought into Poland after the Nazis had marched through and charged with keeping order in the 
occupied state. And their commander knew that it was going to be brutal, because they were in 
wartime, and they regard the Jews for example as enemies, so there was going to be a fair bit of 
rounding up and all of that, and with all of what that implied.

And the commander told the policemen that they could go home if they wanted to, that they didn’t 
have to participate in this. And then, what _Ordinary Men_ does is document their transformation 
from ordinary policemen—the sort of people that you know—to guys who were taking naked, pregnant 
women out into the middle of fields and shooting them in the back of the head. And it documents 
ONE STEP AT A TIME how an ordinary person turns into someone like that. You think ‘well, we don’t 
want that sort of thing to happen anymore.’ Well, then you don’t wanna be that sort of person. 
That’s how it’s fixed. And if you’re not gonna be that sort of person **then you don’t take the 
first steps.** Cuz the first steps lead you down a pathway you don’t—at least in principle—you 
don’t wanna go.

So, I think part of what makes me combative, compared to someone like [Jonathan] Haidt, is I’ve 
spent years looking at the worst things there are to look at. And I’ve learned from that. And I’ve 
certainly learned things that I won’t do. And one of them is I won’t let the government regulate 
my speech. It’s a mistake. I don’t care what compassionate principles hypothetically motivate that 
move. It was _unprecedented_ in English common law, that move. It was all buried under this 
leftist “compassion” which is mostly… it’s mostly a lie."

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 26 - The Phenomenology of the Divine
`[1:26:15]` “I’d also say if you’re interested in Jung, the best book to read is _The Origins and 
History of Consciousness_. It’s the best intro to the Jungian world.”

`[1:44:40]` “But that’s the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is lost—that’s the redemptive 
substance—and the knights of King Arthur go off to search for the Holy Grail. But they don’t know 
where to look! So, where do you look when you don’t know where to look? For something you need, 
desperately, but have lost? Well, each of the knights goes into the forest at the point that looks 
darkest to him.

And that’s Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell. It’s like: **that which you fear and avoid. That 
which you hold in contempt. That which disgusts you and that you avoid. That’s the gateway to what 
you need to know.** There’s nothing new-age about that, that’s for sure.”

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 25 - Walking With God: Noah and the Flood
`[15:45]` “You’ve got the fact that things aren’t exactly the way they should be at least gives 
you something to do, y’know, and maybe something _great_ to do, cuz there’s no shortage of 
suffering and trouble that besets the world that you could conceivably ameliorate in some way. And 
the utility of that and the intrinsic meaning of that is self-evident.

So it also makes me curious about nihilism, for example, and despair, because—I understand those 
emotions, I understand them deeply, and the intellectual mindset that goes along with it; but they 
just seem beside the point to me in some sense because there are so many things that need doing, 
that all you really have to do is open your eyes and look at them, and then decide that you’re 
actually going to do something about them.

And you might think ‘well, what’s within my scope of influence is so trivial that it’s not worth 
doing.’ It’s like, it won’t stay trivial for long if you do it! Not at all. And I don’t think it’s 
trivial to begin with. I don’t think that any—I really don’t believe that anything done right is 
trivial. And my experience in my life has been that anything I actually did paid off. It didn’t 
pay off necessarily in the way that I expected it to pay off, that’s a whole different story. But 
if it was _genuine_ _commitment to do something_, even if it went sideways and the outcome was 
really something other than what I expected, the net consequence over time was nothing but good.”

`[20:28]` “The issue is that there are times in your life where you know that the thing that 
you’re saying is not true. It’s a deception. It’s a lie of some sort, and you’re using it to 
manipulate yourself or another person or the world. And you’re also fully possessed of the idea 
that you can get away with it. And there’s a satanic arrogance about that. In fact, that _is_ the 
archetypal arrogance that’s portrayed in the mythological character of Satan, because Satan is 
precisely the archetype of the element of the mind that believes that it can twist and bend the 
structure of reality without paying the price for that.

And you can’t imagine anything that’s more arrogant than that because really, do you really think 
that you can twist the structure of reality and that that’s going to work out for you without it 
snapping back, is so obvious that that can’t work, that everyone knows it.”

`[23:11]` “And the warning in the Flood story is: don’t [feed with no gratitude and no attempt to 
replenish what it is that you’re taking from] for very long. Because things will happen that are 
so awful that you cannot possibly imagine it. And that’ll happen to you personally, and it’ll 
happen to your family, and it’ll happen to your community, and it’s happened to people over and 
over throughout history.

And it’s quite interesting, y’know, it’s very soon after the story of Cain and Abel, when you see 
evil enter the world in the story of Adam and Eve; along with self-consciousness and evil there is 
the ability—that’s the knowledge of good and evil—that’s the ability to **hurt other 
people**—self-consciously, to _know_ what you’re doing, and then of course instantly Cain takes 
that to the absolute extreme and he uses that capacity to **destroy, really, what he loves best.** 
He gets as close as a human being can to destroying the divine ideal. Because, of course, his 
brother is Abel and Abel is favored by God, and Cain destroys him.

Which, Cain tells God at the end of that episode that his punishment is more than he can bear. And 
I think the reason for that is: **where are you once you destroy your own ideal?** What’s left for 
you? There’s nowhere to go. There’s no up. And when there’s no up, there’s a lot of down.

And, y’know, there’s an idea put forth very nicely in Milton’s _Paradise Lost_, when he was 
describing, from a psychological perspective, essentially what hell is. And hell is...you’re in 
hell to the degree that you’re distant from the good. That might be a good way of thinking about 
it. And if you destroy your own ideal, which you do with jealousy and resentment and the desire to 
pull down people who you would like to be, let’s say, then you end up in a situation that’s 
indistinguishable from hell.

And the way the Biblical story unfolds is, well, it’s Cain…and then it’s the flood. And so Cain 
adopts this mode of being that’s antithetical to being itself, at least to positive being 
itself—he does it voluntarily, he does it knowing full well what he’s doing—and the net 
consequence of this, that it ripples through the entire social structure, is that God stands back 
and says: This whole thing has got [sic] so bad the only thing we can do is wipe it to the ground. 
And that is no joke. That’s _exactly_ how things work.”

`[2:05:30]` “I see this [intellectual arrogance] for example happening in the United States in 
particular because the last time I went down there, for example, I had friends down there and some 
of those friends are very, very smart people. And some of them were talking about the Trump 
voters. And they were talking about the Trump voters with contempt. And I thought ‘you better 
watch that. Cuz that’s 50% of the damn population. And it might be convenient to think that 
they’re stupid and beneath you, but it’s not conducive to a civil state, and there’s no evidence 
that it’s true, because there isn’t a straight line between intelligent and wise.’”

`[1:06:51]` “I’m trying to formulate a sentence, so I try to think up a good sentence that’s 
nailing what I’m trying to formulate, and then I try to pick it apart. And I do that a bunch of 
ways; I take the sentence and I put it on another page and then I write, like, ten different 
variants of the sentence and see if I can get a better variant. And then I try to think of ways 
that it’s a stupid sentence to see if I can, y’know, put a pry bar underneath it and loosen it up.

And if I can’t do anything—if I can’t manage that then I keep the sentence that I’ve got. And I do 
that with ten sentences in a paragraph and I make sure the sentences are all arranged properly in 
the paragraph the same way, by rewriting a bunch of different variants of it, trying to get the 
word right and the phrase right and the sentence right and the sentence order right and the 
paragraph order right. And I can tell when it’s right _enough_ because I can’t make it any better.

That doesn’t mean it’s _right_, it just means *I* can’t improve it. And so I get to the point 
where if I’m writing a paragraph and I write a variant, and I can’t tell if the variant is any 
better and it might be worse, then I’m done. I’ve hit the limit of my intellectual capacity, and 
it’s time to move on."

That’s self-evident. But here’s the rub: sometimes when things are not going well, it’s precisely 
that which is most valued that is the cause. Why? It’s because the world is revealed through the 
template of your values.

If the world you are seeing is not the world you want therefore, it’s time to examine your values. 
It’s time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions.”

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 22 - Adam and Eve: Self-Consciousness, Evil, and Death
`[1:29:18]` “The other thing about marriage—this is really worth knowing too—is that—I learned 
this in part by reading Jung—it’s like what do you do when you get married? That’s easy. You take 
someone who’s just as useless and horrible as you are, and then you shackle yourself to them. And 
then you say: ‘we’re not runnin’ away. No matter what happens.’ Yeah, well that’s perfect because 
then you don’t get to run away.

And the thing is, is like if you can run away you can’t tell each other the truth. Because if you 
tell someone the truth about you and they don’t run away, they weren’t listening. And so if you 
don’t have someone around that can’t run away you can’t tell them the truth. And so that’s part of 
the purpose of the marriage. It’s like okay okay, I’ll bet on you, you bet on me, it’s a losing 
bet, we both know that. But given our current circumstances we’re unlikely to find anyone better, 
that’s for sure.

There are two things that come off of that. One is, y’know people are waiting around to find Mr. 
and Mrs. Right and it’s like, here’s something to think about, man. If you went to a party and you 
found Mr. Right, and he looked at you and didn’t run away screaming, that would indicate that he 
_wasn’t_ Mr. Right **at all**. It’s like the old Nietzschian joke: if someone loves you, that 
should immediately disenchant you with them.

`[2:07:58]` “The shadow is rooted in hell. And you think, well, that’s a nice metaphor. It’s like, 
don’t be so sure it’s a metaphor. It’s not exactly a metaphor. I mean I can elaborate on that a 
little bit.

If you walk down Bloor (?) Street and you watch, you can see people in hell with no problem. 
They’re not only the people who are completely lost—the homeless—but they’re the homeless that you 
cannot look at. And the reason you can’t look at them is they find your act of mirroring their 
state of existence intolerable. It will instantly enrage them. And that’s because they’re in 
chaos, they’re in the underworld, but they’re in a particular suburb of the underworld. And that 
little suburb, that’s hell.

And you think ‘well, is it eternal?’ Depends on what you mean. It’s been around a long time. It’s 
been around a _long_ time. And it’s really deep. And there’s another weird thing about hell, which 
is: if you’re in it, no matter how bad it is, there’s some stupid thing you can do to make it 
worse. And that’s why it’s bottomless.”

#### The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 21 - God and the Hierarchy of Authority
`[2:40:20]` “One of the things I’ve really tried to puzzle out, and it’s not like I believe this, 
right, I’m just telling you where the edges of my thinking has been going, is that you have this 
crazy alliance between the feminists and the radical Islamists that I just do not get. It’s like 
why aren’t they protesting non-stop about Saudi Arabia is just completely beyond me. Like I do NOT 
understand it in the least. And I wonder too, I just wonder—and this is the Freudian me—is that is 
there an attraction that’s emerging among the female radicals for that totalitarian male dominance 
that they’ve chased out of the West? And I mean that’s a hell of a thing to think but after all, I 
am psychoanalytically minded and I DO think things like that. [laughter]

Because I can just see no rational reason for it. The only other rational reason is that ‘well, 
the West needs to fall, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Yeah, so that could be the case. 
But I’m not going to shake my suspicion about this unconscious balancing because as the demand for 
egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity accelerates, there’s going to be a longing in 
the unconscious for the precise opposite of that. The more you scream for equality, the more your 
unconscious is going to admire dominance.”

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6qBxn_hFDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6qBxn_hFDQ)

`[1:46:27]` “Cuz one of the old metaphysical problems is ‘why would God allow evil into the 
world’. I think well maybe God didn’t allow evil into the world; maybe God allowed the possibility 
of evil into the world—that’s different. And maybe the world with the possibility of evil is 
actually a better world than the world without the possibility of evil.

It’s something like that, y’know, in that maybe a man is better when he is a dangerous man who is 
being good than he would be if we was just a good man who wasn’t capable of being dangerous. And I 
believe that because the best men that I have ever met are very dangerous men. You don’t mess with 
them.”

Timon Dias: “So do you think that someone without teeth, or without the options to sin, can be 
good?”

Peterson: “See that’s a real theological question, right? Cuz the question you’re asking is—and 
this is tied up with the idea of free will and evil—‘can a person who doesn’t have the option to 
be evil be good? And I would say no.”

`[1:51:07]` “One of the most amazing things I discovered this year, or stumbled upon, was I was 
puzzling over a line in the New Testament which I’ve always been curious about because it never 
sat right with me: ‘the meek shall inherit the earth.’ …and I found out that the word ‘meek’ 
either doesn’t mean now what it meant when people first translated the text, or it was a 
mistranslation. Either way. Because ‘meek’ sounds like ‘powerless’ and ‘harmless’ or something 
like that. But what ‘meek’ actually means is it’s the derivation of the word, it’s the translation 
of a word that meant something more like ‘**those who have swords and know how to use them, but 
keep them sheathed.**’

And I thought ‘oh yes, that’s exactly it.’ Those who have swords and know how to use them but 
choose to keep them sheathed… ‘shall inherit the world.’ It’s like _yes._ Exactly right.”

#### The Art of Manliness Podcast #335: Exploring Archetypes with Jordan B. Peterson
[https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/)

```
Note: just minutes before this monologue, Peterson makes a distinction between his use of the 
terms masculine/feminine versus male/female; they are not always equivalent in the analysis of 
archetypal stories.
```

“If you look at the movie _Sleeping Beauty_, for example. So the female—the feminine—is 
unconscious in that movie, that’s Sleeping Beauty. And she’s unconscious because she couldn’t 
tolerate the trauma of puberty and sexual development, essentially. And the reason for that is 
because her parents overprotected her, right?

If you remember at the beginning of _Sleeping Beauty_, the king and queen have been waiting a long 
time for their daughter to decide not to invite Maleficent to the christening. And Maleficent is 
the evil queen, right, she’s the negative element of nature and the world, and **if you don’t 
invite the negative—if you don’t _allow_ the negative element of life and the world into your 
child’s environment then you overprotect them and make them weak,** and then when they grow up and 
face the inevitable confrontations of adolescence and adulthood, they deeply desire to remain 
unconscious, or to become unconscious again. That can manifest itself in suicidal ideation, for 
example.

So Sleeping Beauty falls unconscious when she’s pricked, when blood emerges when she’s pricked, 
and it’s just after she, y’know, she falls in love naïvely with the prince, and then that 
collapses. So she can’t tolerate the catastrophe of her existence so she falls unconscious. And 
something has to rescue her. And it’s the hero, it’s the prince.

Now, you can read that as an external prince because in some degree, in a woman’s life, the adult 
feminine in her is awakened by the man that she chooses. So you can read it as a love story, but 
you can also read it as a story of individual development because what the woman is going to use 
to call _herself_ out of unconsciousness is her own masculine propensity to develop her 
consciousness to move forthright out into the world. I mean these archetypal stories can be read 
at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously, they apply across multiple domains.”

`[16:00]` “Those experiences in life where the fundamental constants that keep you oriented shift, 
and then you fall into the unknown, that’s the underworld of mythology. You fall into the unknown. 
And part of that underworld would be hell. Now hell is the part of the underworld that emerges 
when you’re embittered by your failure and you turn towards the desire to destroy. And everyone 
who thinks about this can appreciate that, because most people—at least if they reflect on their 
own experience—can understand full well the negative psychological consequences of falling flat on 
your face. It’s not only that you fail, it’s that you become bitter and turn agains the world. 
That’s a trip to hell for all intents and purposes.”

`[47:25]` “When young men mature and become men, it isn’t power that accrues to them, it’s 
competence. And the problem with the narrative that grips our culture at the moment is that we 
fail to make a distinction between power and competence. Power is just that I can hurt you and 
therefore I dominate. Competence is that I have status because I am offering to myself and to 
other people something that they voluntarily regard as of value. And my invitation to young men is 
to become competent, to forego power. Power is the tactic used by the incompetent to gain status. 
Competence is the tool used by the morally oriented to accrue authority and do good things in the 
world. Well that’s a noble call. And the only way out of the tragedy of existence is to follow the 
noble call.”

`[7:40]` “Life isn’t a game, it’s a set of games. And the rule is: never sacrifice victory across 
the set of games for victory in one game. Right? And that’s what it means to play properly. You 
wanna play so that people keep inviting you to play. Cuz that’s how you win—you win by being 
invited to play the largest possible array of games. And the way you do that is by manifesting the 
fact that you can play in a reciprocal manner every time you play even if there’s victory at 
stake. And that’s what makes you successful across time.

`[8:40]` “And to act morally is not to win today’s contest at the expense of the rest of possible 
contests. And again, I don’t see that as something that’s arbitrary. It’s not relativistic. 
There’s an absolute moral stance there, and everyone recognizes it. And I also think it’s the key 
to success.

And I would also say it’s very much akin in a strange way, like the person who is the master at 
being invited to play the largest possible number of games is also the same person that goes out 
forthrightly to conquer the unknown before it presents itself as the enemy at the door. They’re 
the same thing.”

`[10:08]` “There’s a recognition there in the image that the person who’s most dominant—who has 
the most authority—is the one who’s voluntarily accepted the suffering that’s a part of being. And 
that’s what that picture represents. It’s like the authority holds [a cross] and says ‘This is 
what you have to accept.’ And that transfixes the viewer, because of the fact that it’s true.

Think about it this way: do you like brave people, or do you like cowards? Well that’s pretty 
straightforward. And what’s the ultimate act of bravery? It’s to come to terms with the fact that 
you’re mortal and limited, and to live forthrightly regardless. Well obviously, that’s what is at 
the core of what’s admirable.”

`[37:50]` “Get it into your head that you have the capacity for great evil. And stop 
targeting—stop assuming that that’s something manifesting itself only in the people that you 
disagree with politically. Take responsibility for that, and try to put your life together.”

`[1:45:30]` “What Marx observed was that capital tended to accumulate in the hands of fewer and 
fewer people. And he said that’s a flaw of the capitalist system. THAT’S wrong. It’s not a flaw of 
the capitalist system. It is a _feature_ of every single system of production that we know of no 
matter who set it up and how it operates. And so now we have a problem, because what happens is as 
soon as you set up a domain of production—and you need to because you need things to be 
produced—then you instantly produce a competition, and the spoils go disproportionately to a tiny percentage of people.

So then, so what? So the rest of the people starve, or the system becomes unstable because 
everybody’s mad. It’s like, that’s a big problem. 'Kay, so how do human beings fix that? Well the 
first thing we did was diversify the number of productive games. So you don’t get to be an NBA 
basketball star, okay, but you can run a podcast. It’s a completely different competitive 
landscape. So we can fractionate the production landscape, and then people who aren’t successful 
in one domain might be successful in others; that’s human creativity.”

`[5:38]` “Actually I’d just as soon we got rid of the whole hate speech thing because I think it’s 
unbelievably dangerous to drive people who hate underground **and not let them talk.** That’s 
partly because you don’t know where they are, you don’t know what they’re doing, and **you can’t 
refute them.”**

#### The Joe Rogan Experience #958 - Jordan Peterson
(Peterson)

`[1:41:35]` “So imagine that the normal world of mankind is inside that dominance hierarchy where 
everything is going well, because nothing abnormal is happening and you’re getting what you need 
and you want and your conscious knowledge suffices. Right? Okay, but then something tilts, and 
that structure no longer works. Where do you end up? You end up in the underworld. That’s when 
your partner of 20 years has a long-term affair, and you find out about it. It’s like you thought 
you knew where you were…but you didn’t. And now that you found out, you don’t know where you are. 
**When you don’t know where you are, you’re in the underworld.**

Right, and that’s where the unconscious forces play: those are the gods, that’s why there’s gods 
in the underworld. And people go to the underworld all the time. It’s chaos and fear and 
depression, and hopelessness and imaginativeness, it’s everything—it’s chaos. It’s terrifying 
_and_ promising, because dragons have gold. Because the unknown has two things, just like the 
future. It’s like ‘look out, it’ll do you in’ and ‘look out, it offers everything to you.’ That’s 
the underworld.”

`[2:03:15]` “We’re very complicated creatures, and we’re run by all sorts of very strange things 
down there in the unconscious, y’know, and the Greeks thought we were the playthings of the gods 
because we serve lust, we serve thirst, we serve hunger, we serve _rage_. And y’know those things 
all transcend us. So that’s why they were gods. Y’know, rage—that’s the war god. Well, why is it a 
god? Well, it exists forever. It exists in all people. It takes them over and directs their 
behavior. It’s a god.

Well, you can quibble about the details: ‘no it’s not a god.’ Ok fine, it’s a psychological force.”

Rogan: “Right, people get hung up on that one word.”

Peterson: “Well they don’t really… we have to think about it functionally to some degree, we have 
to think about what that idea means. We’ve had that idea forever; it isn’t just some superstition. 
Jesus, you gotta be more sophisticated than that, man! And this is partly what I think is 
unfortunate about the new atheists, let’s say: they don’t take the damn problem seriously. They 
think ‘well, Christianity, that’s just a bunch of superstition.’ It’s like: really?? No. Sorry. 
That’s just not deep enough man."

`[2:24:46]` “So then we ask people: ‘Ok, so here think about this real carefully. Take all your 
faults and inadequacies, and your hatred for life, all of that. And imagine that gets the upper 
hand. And then think about where you could be in three to five years.’ Everyone knows, eh?

Some people know they’d be a street person, some people know they’d be an alcoholic, some people 
know they’d be a prostitute or a drug addict. Like everybody’s got their own little hell they 
could descend into, with fair degree of rapidity and a fair bit of enjoyment. And people _know_ 
that, and so I say well, delineate that out too, so you know where you’re headed when you fall off 
the path. And so then you’re running away, and running towards…it’s like yes, that’s heaven and 
hell. And you need it. And they’re real. They’re as real as anything you can… It depends on what 
you mean by ‘real’ I suppose, but… they’re as real as you make them, how about that. And people 
can make hell pretty real.”

`[2:41:00]` “I know for many people someone who’s rich is someone who has more money than them. 
Right? Which is one of the things I really find funny about the radical left protests on the 
campuses, it’s like ‘down with the 1%’. It’s like ‘hey, sunshine, you’re part of the 1%. You’re 
actually a baby 1/10th of 1% or maybe 1/100th of 1%, or you’re just angry because you’re not there 
_yet_. But you will be when you’re 40\. And you know it and so does everybody else. And now 
instead of regarding yourself properly as a fledgling member of the elite, you wanna have it both 
ways. You wanna be fledgling member of the elite, and champion of the underprivileged. So how 
narcissistic can you get? You wanna have all the benefits of having all the benefits, and you want 
all the benefits of having none of the benefits. Because just  all the benefits isn’t enough for 
you.”
